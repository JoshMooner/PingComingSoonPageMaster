## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design with media query


### What I learned

I learned how to valid a form usign JS and manage css styles properties since JS. Also, I learned how to use the em and rem measures to creat a responsive site with media query

### Continued development

I want to keep focusing on the manage of styles properties on JS and to keep learning JS on a newbie-junior level.I'm not sure if the warning messages hide and show is done in an optimal way, I think it could be developed in a better way.
